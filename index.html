          <h1>week three</h1>
          <h2>By Yours Truly | March 28 2017</h2>
            <p>So it's Tuesday, and here we are in the middle of week three! Woot woot! I'm really surprised I've made it so far without any seriously crippling mental breakdowns.</p>
            <p>Currently I'm feeling really confident in my HTML and CSS capabilities and I'm also starting to discover that I really enjoy web design and all that other creative jazz. However, this causes some internal struggles cause my creative brain likes to overrun my logical brain and then I end up spending way to much time trying to decide on the perfect shade of mauve, or which serif and sans-serif fonts work best together. On that note, I have found that the internet can be a scary black-hole of information overload if you're not careful. So future me, or anyone else reading this (are other people really going to read this......??) YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
            <p>Week three has also meant delving further into the infamous JavaScript.. which is still somewhat of an enigma to me. At times I feel like a total JavaScript master and at other times I want to cry silent tears into my keyboard.</p>
